2. Drag the plugin into the "plugins" folder of your server directory.
3. Start or restart your server.
4. Stop the server.
5. Go to settings.yml in GrantX's config directory and find the "commands" section.
6. Input the commands that will modify the player's rank within your permissions plugin for the given situation (contact support for pre-made commands for your permissions plugin).
7. Start the server again.
8. The plugin should now enable properly. If it does not, read the section about MC-Market downloads below, check the wiki for common fixes to errors, or contact support.
