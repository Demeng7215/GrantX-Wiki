# Configuration
Configuring GrantX to your liking.

## Configuration Files
A list of configuration files with their factory default values can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/Demeng7215/GrantX-Wiki/tree/master/configs). Files ending in **.db** are NOT configuration files and you should not touch them if you don't know what you are doing unless you want to corrupt grant data.

## Available Materials
Since GrantX focuses on GUI menus, there are many cases in the config files where you need to enter a material name. [Click here](https://github.com/Demeng7215/GrantX-Wiki/blob/master/Available%20Materials.java) for a list of valid materials.

## Placeholders
Coming soon...
